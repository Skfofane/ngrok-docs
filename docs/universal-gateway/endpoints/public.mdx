# Public Endpoints

## Overview

Public endpoints are how you receive traffic from the public internet. They are
the most common endpoint binding and the easiest way to get started with ngrok.
Public endpoints listen on ngrok's global [points of
presence](/universal-gateway/network/points-of-presence/) to receive traffic
from the internet.

[Domains](/universal-gateway/domains/) and [TCP
Addresses](/universal-gateway/tcp-addresses/) determine what URLs your public
endpoints may use. [TLS Certificates](/universal-gateway/tcp-addresses/) are
used to terminate TLS traffic to your public endpoints.

Public endpoints have a
[binding](/universal-gateway/endpoints/overview/#binding) of `public`, which is
the default binding if you do not specify one when creating an endpoint.

## Authentication

Public endpoints are accessible to the public internet. When you're hosting a
blog or a marketing website, that's desirable. But often you want to restrict
access to only an authorized set of clients, even if the endpoints are publicly
addressable. You can use [Traffic Policy](/traffic-policy) to limit access to
your endpoints with authentication and authorization like JWT, OAuth, IP
Restrictions, Mutual TLS and more.

The documentation for each endpoint protocol has more information about the
types of authentication you may use to restrict access to your endpoints:

- [HTTP Authentication](/universal-gateway/endpoints/http/#authentication)
- [TCP Authentication](/universal-gateway/endpoints/tcp/#authentication)
- [TLS Authentication](/universal-gateway/endpoints/tls/#authentication)

## URLs

When you create a public endpoint, the URL you create it with is validated
differently based on the protocol of the URL.

### `http`

- The hostname must match a [Domain](/universal-gateway/domains/) in your account.
- The hostname must be a domain with a valid [public suffix](https://publicsuffix.org/).
- The port must be `80`. If you do not specify a port, the default `80` will be used for you.

**Examples**

- `http://example.ngrok.app`
- `http://example.ngrok.app:80`
- `http://example.party`
- `http://example.ngrok.app:81` - invalid port, must be `80`, not `81`
- `http://example.doesnotexist` - invalid hostname: `.doesnotexist` is not a public suffix domain
- `http://example.internal` - invalid hostname: `.internal` is not a public suffix domain

### `https`, `tls`

- The hostname must match a [Domain](/universal-gateway/domains/) in your account.
- The hostname must be a domain with a valid [public suffix](https://publicsuffix.org/).
- The port must be `443`. If you do not specify a port, the default `443` will be used for you.

**Examples**

- `https://example.ngrok.app`
- `https://example.ngrok.app:443`
- `https://example.party`
- `https://example.ngrok.app:8443` - invalid port, must be `443`
- `https://example.nosuchtld` - invalid hostname, `.nosuchtld` is not a public suffix domain
- `https://example.internal` - invalid hostname, public endpoints cannot use `.internal`

### `tcp`

- You must specify a port number in TCP URLs.
- The hostname and port must match the address of a [TCP
  Address](/universal-gateway/tcp-addresses) in your account.

**Examples**

- `tcp://1.tcp.ngrok.io:12345`
- `tcp://1.tcp.eu.ngrok.io:12345`
- `tcp://1.tcp.ngrok.io` - invalid, does not specify a port number
- `tcp://example.ngrok.app:12345` - invalid, does not match a TCP Address
- `tcp://your-domain.com:12345` - invalid, does not match a TCP Adress

## API

Public endpoints can be created programatically. Consult the documentation on
[Endpoint APIs](/endpoints/overview/#api).

## Pricing

Public endpoints are available on all plans. Consult the [Endpoints
Pricing](/universal-gateway/endpoints/overview/#pricing) documentation for
billing details.
