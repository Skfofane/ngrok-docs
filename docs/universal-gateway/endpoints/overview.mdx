# Endpoints

Endpoints are at the center of everything in ngrok; they are how you receive,
route, transform and forward traffic. Endpoints are how you put your apps and
APIs online.

## What is an endpoint?

## Quickstart

## URL

TODO
An endpoint's URL is how you connect to it.

## Protocol

Endpoints have one of four supported **protocols**:

- [HTTP/S Endpoints](/universal-gateway/endpoints/http) - `http`, `https`
- [TCP Endpoints](/universal-gateway/endpoints/tcp) - `tcp`
- [TLS Endpoints](/universal-gateway/endpoints/tls) - `tls`

An Endpoint's protocol is specified in the scheme of its [URL](#url), e.g.
`https://app.example.com`, `tcp://db.internal:3306`

An Endpoint's protocol determines:

1. how it processes connections that it receives
1. the phases, variables, and actions that may be defined on its [Traffic
   Policy](#traffic-policy).
1. what hostnames and ports may be specified in its URL

## Type

Endpoints have a **type**, either `agent` or `cloud`. An Endpoint's `type`
determines its lifecycle, where its configuration is defined, and how it
handles connections.

**Agent Endpoints** (`agent`) are for creating connectivity to upstream
applications. They are created and configured by Secure Tunnel agent processes
and live for the lifetime of that agent process. They forward connections they
receive to the agent that started them.

**Cloud Endpoints** (`cloud`) are persistent endpoints whose creation, deletion
and configuration is managed centrally via the Dashboard or API. They use
Traffic Policy to handle traffic, usually routing to Agent Endpoints.

##### Lifecycle

- **Agent Endpoints** are created by Secure Tunnel agents. They live for the
  lifetime of the agent process that started them. When the agent process
  terminates, the endpoint is removed.
- **Cloud Endpoints** are persistent endpoints created via the API or Dashboard.
  They exist permanently until they are explicitly deleted.

##### Connection Handling

- **Agent Endpoints** forward their traffic to the agent that created them.
- **Cloud Endpoints** handle traffic they receive via their Traffic Policy.

##### Configuration

- **Agent Endpoints** configuration is defined by the agent which initiated them.
  The API and Dashboard provide a read-only view of their configuration.
- **Cloud Endpoints** configuration is managed centrally via the API or Dashboard.

## Binding

Endpoints have a **binding** which is one: `public`, `internal` or
`kubernetes`. An Endpoint's binding determines where it is available to receive
traffic. Said another way, the binding defines where an endpoint 'listens'.

- **Public Endpoints** (`public`) - Endpoints with a `public` binding have a
  publicly addressable URL that receives traffic from the internet via the
  ngrok cloud service's global points of presence. e.g.
  `https://inconshreveable.ngrok.app`, `https://blog.inconshreveable.com`.

- **Internal Endpoints** (`internal`) - Endpoints with an `internal` binding
  can only receive traffic forwarded to them from other Endpoints in your ngrok
  account via the `forward-internal`. Internal endpoints have URLs that end in
  `.internal`. Example URLs: `https://example.internal`, `tcp://ssh.internal:22`

- **Kubernetes Endpoints** (`kubernetes`) - Endpoints with a `kubernetes`
  binding are private endpoints that are only available inside of Kubernetes
  clusters where you installed the ngrok [Kubernetes Operator](/k8s). Example
  URLs: `http://service.namespace`, `tcp://db.controlplane:5432`

## Traffic Policy

Every endpoint may specify a [Traffic Policy](/traffic-policy) to handle the
traffic it receives with actions to route, transform, authenticate or reject
the traffic it receives.

TODO Example

## Pooling

[Endpoint Pooling](/universal-gateway/endpoints/pooling) allows you to create
multiple endpoints with the same URL. Traffic sent to a URL with an Endpoint
Pool is load balanced among the Endpoints in the pool.

You may set `allow_pooling: false` on an Endpoint to disallow Endpoint Pooling
on its URL.

:::info Coming Soon

This feature is not yet generally available. [Contact us](mailto:support@ngrok.com) to
request access.

## API

[Cloud Endpoints](/universal-gateway/endpoints/cloud-endpoints) are
programatically managed via:

- [`/endpoints` API Resource](/api/resources/endpoints/) of the [API](/api/)
- [`CloudEndpoint` CRD](/k8s/crds/) of the [Kubernetes Operator](/k8s/)

[Agent Endpoints](/universal-gateway/endpoints/agent-endpoints), by contrast,
are programtically managed via:

- [Agent SDKs](/agent-sdks/)
- [Agent API](/agent/api/)
- [Kubernetes Operator](/k8s/getting-started-kic/)

Agent Endpoints are also included in a read-only capacity via:

- [`/endpoints` API Resource](/api/resources/endpoints/#list-endpoints) of the [API](/api)

## Pricing

Seat-based plans (Personal, Pro and Enterprise) include a fixed number of
endpoints that you may create based on the number of licenses you have
purchased.

On the Pay-as-you-go plan, there is no limit on the number of endpoints you
create. An endpoint that transmits data in a billing period is counted as an
active endpoint for billing purposes.

See [Pricing](https://ngrok.com/pricing)
for additional details on endpoint billing and pricing.
